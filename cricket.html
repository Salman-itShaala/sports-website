        Cricket is a popular sport – so popular that it is considered the second
        most-loved sport in the world. It is enjoyed by more than 2.5 billion
        fans in 180 countries. This sport is most popular in England, Australia,
        and subcontinental Asia (especially India and Pakistan).

        Cricket has its roots in the early 16th century. However, the first
        written rules for the game of cricket were penned in 1728 by Alan
        Brodick and the Duke of Richmond.

      <li>
        Cricket was originally a children’s game played in England during the
        16th century, specifically in the southeastern counties. When the
        British expanded overseas, they brought the game with them.
